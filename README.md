# bulkticketresolver
This was a small project I created for an issue in my Tech Services Internship Class.

The issue was that we have a ticketing system (SolarWinds) and had a couple hundred tickets to resolve.

SolarWinds does offer bulk ticket editing, but only to admins!!!!

To solve this I created this python script to automatically resolve a bulk amount of tickets. (Just a simple macro that repeats for each individual number).

Anywho, if anyone where to use this (I have no idea why you would), here are the directions:

SolarWinds bulk ticket resolver. Devoloped by: Quinn Brooks

This program has been specially designed for a 2560x1600 resolution screen running Google Chrome.
After reading this message, you will be prompted to enter your ticket numbers. You will then have two seconds to quickly switch to Google Chrome in full screen mode, which should be pulled up on service desk page of your SolarWinds ticketing system.
